  <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    Welcome to our platform. By accessing or using our services, submitting an investment request, 
    or engaging with our investment opportunities, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions 
    ("Terms"). These Terms apply to all investment requests made through our platform, as well as all 
    associated communications, agreements, and transactions with the company. Please read these Terms 
    carefully before proceeding with your investment. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, 
    you should refrain from making any investment or using our platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    These Terms may be updated periodically. It is your responsibility to review these Terms regularly. 
    Your continued use of our platform or engagement with the company after changes to these Terms are posted 
    will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Acceptance of Investment</h4>
  <p>
    When you submit an investment request through our platform, it will be subject to review and approval 
    by the company. The company will contact you separately to discuss and finalize your investment request, 
    including associated risks and what to expect moving forward. We reserve the right to reject or accept 
    investment requests at our discretion. Once your investment request is accepted, a confirmation email 
    or message will be sent to you within 3-5 business days. At this point, your investment will be 
    considered locked in, and the terms outlined in this document will come into full effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that submitting an investment request does not guarantee its acceptance, and the company 
    reserves the right to assess your request based on various factors, including but not limited to 
    financial regulations, available opportunities, and market conditions.
  </p>

  <h4>3. Investment Lock-In Period</h4>
  <p>
    Your investment is subject to a lock-in period of 7 calendar days from the date your request is accepted 
    and confirmed. During this lock-in period, you will not have the ability to modify or withdraw your 
    investment, as the funds will be fully committed. This lock-in period allows us to allocate resources 
    and manage funds effectively on behalf of all investors.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the lock-in period has expired, withdrawal options will be made available under the conditions 
    outlined in Section 4 ("Withdrawal of Investment").
  </p>

  <h4>4. Withdrawal of Investment</h4>
  <p>
    Once the 7-day lock-in period has ended, you may request to withdraw your investment in accordance with 
    the following conditions:

    <li><strong>Withdrawal within 8-14 days:</strong> You will receive 90% of your initial investment amount, 
    subject to a deduction for early withdrawal fees and any applicable charges.</li>

    plus any applicable returns or interest, depending on market conditions, company performance, and subject 
    to applicable taxes and fees.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Withdrawal requests must be initiated by contacting the company directly. The company will contact you to discuss

    in extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to market disruptions, liquidity issues, or unforeseen 
    financial events.
  </p>

  <h4>5. Profit Distribution</h4>
  <p>
    Any profits generated from your investment will be distributed on a quarterly basis. The first profit 
    distribution will occur 90 days after the acceptance of your investment, provided that the company 
    has met its performance goals and achieved positive financial outcomes as outlined in its investment 
    prospectus.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Profit distributions will be paid out as either dividends or interest, depending on the nature 
    of your investment and your share of the overall investment pool.</li>
    <li>Distributions are subject to applicable taxes, regulatory fees, and administrative costs. You 
    are responsible for reporting and paying any taxes due on profit distributions according to the 
    laws in your jurisdiction.</li>

    distributions may be delayed or reduced. No guarantee is made regarding the frequency or amount 
    of profits paid to investors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The company will provide regular updates on the status of your investment and projected profit 
    distributions. Any delays in profit payouts will be communicated in advance.

  <p>
    In the event of early termination, you may not be entitled to receive the full value of your investment.
